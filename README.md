# BurgerBaron
Creating burgers from an external file. 

## Creating the Stack 
We could not use a built in stack function, so I had to create a stack from scratch including its pop and push functions as well as peek. 

## Implementing Recipies
We were given a text file that had certain recipies on it, and depending on how it was worded, we had to show the user the "stack" of the burger and all of its recipies.
